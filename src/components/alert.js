If you are sensitive to this type of language PLEASE TURN BACK NOW!!  At least we can say we warned you!  \n\nAlso, this site is meant to be used in good fun with people who share your weird, depraved sense of humor.  Please do not harass anyone as it goes against the general spirit of the site and is just not nice.  As the great Abraham Lincoln once said: \'Be excellent to each other.  AND PARTY ON DUDES!!\'  \n\nSeriously, don\'t be a dick (We warned you about the language!)...")
